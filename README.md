🕹️ Cub3d: Where Pixels Meet Perspective

Welcome to the rabbit hole of retro gaming reimagined! Cub3d isn't just another 42 school project; it's a time machine that'll teleport you back to the era of pixelated glory while keeping one foot firmly planted in modern coding practices.

🎮 Nostalgia Meets Ingenuity

Remember those heart-pounding moments navigating maze-like corridors in Wolfenstein 3D? Now imagine recreating that magic, pixel by painstaking pixel. That's Cub3d for you – a labor of love that marries the charm of 90s gaming with the precision of contemporary C programming.

🧠 Raycasting: Your New Superpower

Prepare to don your metaphorical developer cape as you dive into the world of raycasting. You'll bend light to your will, transforming a 2D map into a 3D masterpiece that would make even the most seasoned game devs of yesteryear nod in approval.

🚀 Beyond the Project: Your Gateway to Graphics Programming

Cub3d isn't just about ticking boxes on an assignment sheet. It's your golden ticket to the fascinating realm of graphics programming. By the time you're done, you'll be seeing the world in rays and angles, dreaming in textures and sprites.
Are you ready to challenge your perception, push your coding skills to the limit, and create something that's equal parts nostalgic and groundbreaking? Dive in, and let's turn those cubes into a universe!
